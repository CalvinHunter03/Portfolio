    This was my Capstone project created in Unity 2D. It was my second game in development with a bigger group of people. I jumped onto the development after the game was already created. I was helping add features and fix bugs. I helped to come up with new features that should be added into the game. I worked on the minimap in the game, making sure that once you explored a section of the map, it would appear in real time on the minimap. I also created different map templates for the world generation to use. The world generates like a big puzzle, putting different pieces together to create the big map players can explore. I also created a mechanic in the game where the player can pick up certain objects and throw them around. They will deal damage to enemies and break upon contact, randomly dropping an item. 
    </p>

        I learned a lot more about the Unity game engine and how it all functions for 2d games. I worked closely with the tile sprite editor while creating the minimap. I used a camera that detected its own layer that I painted over the existing map to display the minimap in the corner. Since I was creating map blocks as well, I was getting accustomed to designing areas the player would find fun and enjoyable while playing the game. When developing the item throwing, I was using a lot of trigonometry to figure out the flight path of the object and making sure in the game everything looked and functioned correctly. 
    </p>

    I figured out that working with a big team requires a lot of communication. Since I joined the team when part of the game was already developed, it was an adjustment from my other projects. I was having to figure out who was working on what and how everything connected to each other in the game. After constant communication with the team, I was able to figure everything out and production went very smoothly. It was very fun working with a bigger team and seeing everything come together to create a beautiful final product.
