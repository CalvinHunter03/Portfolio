<p>This game was a class project. They gave us the game engine to work on which was GDevelop and told us to make a game. There weren't too many restrictions for the creation, just that it had to be a completed game. My roommate and I came up with the idea in about a day and just started production. I was mainly in charge or creating the art. I hand drew all of the art assets in the game in Adobe Fresco on my Ipad. I was also in charge of creating the sound design for the game. Most of the sound effects in the game are my voice.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about what makes up a complete game. I learned that there are a lot of art assets that create up a game. Making sure every little detail fits together was challenging for me. I had to tweak some of the assets multiple times just to make sure everything was cohesive. This was my first time working with sound design as well. It was really fun trying to figure out ways to use my voice to project a clear emotion given to the player. </p>
<p>This project took about 2 weeks to complete.</p>
